Please note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) just to not invest time for webpack configuration juggling. Same reason for this project doesn't have SCSS connected.


### Requirements

To run the project you must add 2 API keys into `.env` file. Instructions can be found in `.env.example` file.

After env variables configured - `yarn start` and that's all.
